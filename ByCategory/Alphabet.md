# Alphabet

### 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary - Easy (Convert the alphabetic chars into integers)

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

#### Approach 1: Check Adjacent Words

**Intuition**

The words are sorted lexicographically if and only if adjacent words are. This is because order is transitive: `a <= b` and `b <= c` implies `a <= c`.

**Algorithm**

Let's check whether all adjacent words `a` and `b` have `a <= b`.

To check whether `a <= b` for two adjacent words `a` and `b`, we can find their first difference. For example, `"applying"` and `"apples"` have a first difference of `y` vs `e`. After, we compare these characters to the index in `order`.

Care must be taken to deal with the blank character effectively. If for example, we are comparing `"app"` to `"apply"`, this is a first difference of `(null)` vs `"l"`.

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(C), where C is the total *content* of `words`.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
